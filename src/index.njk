      <p> I'm Dharmesh Makvana — a Robotics Enthusiast, graduate of LD College of Engineering, and a former PhD researcher at IIT Gandhinagar. </p>

      <p style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0"> I’m a certified and professionally trained CAD Designer with a deep-rooted passion for robotics. My passion lies in bridging design and code to create intelligent, responsive machines. It’s an incredible feeling to watch your creation move with purpose, respond, and think. That spark is what keeps me building.</p>

      <p style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0"> Today, I’m proud to say I’m actually building robots, turning a dream into reality. I specialize in designing, developing, and integrating intelligent robotic systems that seamlessly blend hardware and software to tackle real-world automation challenges. </p>

      <p style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0"> Feel free to explore the rest of this site to see the engineering projects I’ve built. </p>
