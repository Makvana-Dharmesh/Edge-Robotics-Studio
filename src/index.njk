        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>I’m Dharmesh Makvana, a robotics enthusiast and graduate of LD College of Engineering, with research experience as a PhD scholar at IIT Gandhinagar.</p>

        <p>I’m a certified CAD Designer with a passion for bringing design and code together to build intelligent, responsive machines. For me, the real reward is in seeing a creation move with purpose and respond to its surroundings. That spark is what drives me to keep building.</p>

        <p>Today, I’m fortunate to work on projects that turn this passion into reality. I design, develop, and integrate robotic systems that blend hardware and software to solve real-world automation problems.</p>

        <p>Feel free to explore the rest of this site to see some of the projects I’ve worked on.</p>
